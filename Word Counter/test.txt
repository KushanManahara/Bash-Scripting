To use this script, save the code to a file with a .sh extension (e.g. wordcount.sh), make the file executable using the chmod +x wordcount.sh command, and run the script by typing ./wordcount.sh in the terminal. When prompted, enter the name of the text file you want to analyze (e.g. example.txt). The script will then output the word count, line count, and character count for the file.
